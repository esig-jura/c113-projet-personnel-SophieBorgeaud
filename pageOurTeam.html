<p>Energetic Cornell graduate who sings his way through deals. Sometimes oversells the pitch… literally.</p>
<h3>Accounting</h3>
<h4>Angela Martin – Head of Accounting</h4>
<p>Precise, detail-oriented, and a strict enforcer of office rules. Loves cats almost as much as balancing ledgers.</p>

    anyone who will listen.</p>
<h4>Kevin Malone – Accountant</h4>
